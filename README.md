# Getting Started with Create React App

A responsive web application that accesses the PUNK API

## APP deploy

Take a look at my app: https://tender-sammet-53d833.netlify.app/


### `The app will have the following views:``

**`Home:`** shows a simple list of available beers and search or filter beers by name, min-max abv, food matches;
**`Beer detail modal view:`** the view is accessible through both search and favourites. It shows details about a single beer: name, ibu, abv, ebs, description, image and food matches. The user can also choose to select a beer as a favourite;
**`Favourites:`** this view lists all the user's favourite beers. The favourites are to be persisted through sessions.
